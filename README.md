# DOVE: Doodled Vessel Enhancement for Photoacoustic Angiography Super Resolution

## ðŸš€ Brief
This project presents a PyQt implementation for **Super-Resolution Photoacoustic Angiography Assisted by Images Forged from Hand-Drawn Graffiti**. 
Leveraging the concept of **Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement** [Project](https://iterative-refinement.github.io/), 
our application allows users to draw graffiti on a board, generating its corresponding photoacoustic version within minutes. 
The implementation is coded using PyQt5.

## ðŸš€ How to Use


```
# First, download the model from Google Drive and place it in ./experiments
# [Google Drive Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XWXWG4DAw0ZPd0N_3r-7jQMF5WMKyOG0/view?usp=share_link)
cd dir_of_the_project
python ./main.py

```

**(a)-(g): The schematic illustrates the training process for super-resolution blood vessel images in Photoacoustic Angiography (PAA) forged from hand-drawn doodles. It includes steps such as generating rain-like noise, hand-drawn doodles, input image generation, normalized Gaussian noise, PAA image generation, normalized PAA image, and reconstructed super-resolution PAA image. (a')-(f'): The corresponding schematic for training super-resolution blood vessel images in PAA forged from cropped images.**

## ðŸš€Results
### Forging realistic photoacoustic images.
*Note:* We generate different kinds of photoacoustic images by adding noise of Gaussian distribution. 
The left two are input images, while the right two are their corresponding photoacoustic versions.

**The left two are input images while the right are their photoacoustic version.**

### * ðŸš€Photoacoustic image super-resolution
*Note:* The shallow and deep feature extraction of SwinIR enables us to utilize the self-similarity of blood vessel images.
These results also prove the abilities of our proposed method in forging photoacoustic images.
